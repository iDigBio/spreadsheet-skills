##Searching the iDigBio Portal:

- different kinds of searching - free text, exact match (a lot of fields are exact match)
- scientific name is what people entered in the scientific name field (ie not higher taxonomy)
	Try: Search by Membracidae
- meaning of present or missing fields, is for the field, not the value in the field

* search only by regular darwin core fields (basic darwin core)

Task: Find all records from ranches in Texas

* Whitsett New Ranch in Texas (idigbio normalizes during searches), can only search by one word in a field or exact match. But you have the general search!

* download and open and scream! What are all these fields!?!?!
	data files and master spreadsheet: https://goo.gl/gyRwx7
	
* Open downloads in text editor

* Open downloads to view in excel
	What is weird about the datasets? how are they different and explain differences.
	Json, one is normalized and one is not, how many decimal places are really good?, user defined fields, so many identifiers?!?!
	
* hide all non-locality fields (how is this iteratively efficient?)

* now download all things "Ranch". Remember to select only those with geocoordinates are present (limit by Armstrong Co.).

* duplicates when you are sorting, why? Thats because this is specimen records
